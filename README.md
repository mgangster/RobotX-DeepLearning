## Deep Learning Project ##

In this project, you will train a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation. So-called “follow me” applications like this are key to many fields of robotics and the very same techniques you apply here could be extended to scenarios like advanced cruise control in autonomous vehicles or human-robot collaboration in industry.


## Setup Instructions
**Clone the repository**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mgangster/RobotX-DeepLearning.git
```



**Install Dependencies**

You'll need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks installed to do this project.  The best way to get setup with these if you are not already is to use Anaconda following along with the [RobotX-Python-StarterKit-master]

If for some reason you choose not to use Anaconda, you must install the following frameworks and packages on your system:
* Python 3.x
* Tensorflow 1.2.1
* NumPy 1.11
* SciPy 0.17.0
* eventlet 
* Flask
* h5py
* PIL
* python-socketio
* scikit-image
* transforms3d
* PyQt4/Pyqt5



## Training, Predicting and Scoring ##

**Note**: Training CNNs is a very compute-intensive process. If your system does not have a recent Nvidia graphics card, with [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda) installed , you may need to perform the training step in the cloud. 

### Training your Model ###
**Prerequisites**
- Training data is in `data` directory
- Validation data is in the `data` directory
- The folders `data/train/images/`, `data/train/masks/`, `data/validation/images/`, and `data/validation/masks/` should exist and contain the appropriate data

To train complete the network definition in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook and then run the training cell with appropriate hyperparameters selected.

After the training run has completed, your model will be stored in the `data/weights` directory as an [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) file, and a configuration_weights file. As long as they are both in the same location, things should work. 

**Important Note** the *validation* directory is used to store data that will be used during training to produce the plots of the loss, and help determine when the network is overfitting your data. 

The **sample_evalution_data** directory contains data specifically designed to test the networks performance on the FollowME task. In sample_evaluation data are three directories each generated using a different sampling method. The structure of these directories is exactly the same as `validation`, and `train` datasets provided to you. For instance `patrol_with_targ` contains an `images` and `masks` subdirectory. If you would like to the evaluation code on your `validation` data a copy of the it should be moved into `sample_evaluation_data`, and then the appropriate arguments changed to the function calls in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.

The notebook has examples of how to evaulate your model once you finish training. Think about the sourcing methods, and how the information provided in the evaluation sections relates to the final score. Then try things out that seem like they may work. 

## Scoring ##

To score the network on the Follow Me task, two types of error are measured. First the intersection over the union for the pixelwise classifications is computed for the target channel. 

In addition to this we determine whether the network detected the target person or not. If more then 3 pixels have probability greater then 0.5 of being the target person then this counts as the network guessing the target is in the image. 

We determine whether the target is actually in the image by whether there are more then 3 pixels containing the target in the label mask. 

Using the above the number of detection true_positives, false positives, false negatives are counted. 

**How the Final score is Calculated**

The final score is the pixelwise `average_IoU*(n_true_positive/(n_true_positive+n_false_positive+n_false_negative))` on data similar to that provided in sample_evaulation_data


## Experimentation: Testing in Simulation
1. Copy your saved model to the weights directory `data/weights`.
2. Launch the simulator, select "Spawn People", and then click the "Follow Me" button.
3. Run the realtime follower script
```
$ python follower.py model_weights.h5
```

**Note:** If you'd like to see an overlay of the detected region on each camera frame from the drone, simply pass the `--pred_viz` parameter to `follower.py`
